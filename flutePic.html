                    the throne has stepped forward. Ian also plays ethnic flutes and whistles together with acoustic guitar and the mandolin family of instruments, providing the acoustic textures which has been an integral part of most of the Tull repertoire.
                    Anderson has so far recorded seven diverse solo albums in his career: 1983’s “Walk Into Light”, the flute instrumental “Divinities” album for EMI’s Classical Music Division in 1995 which reached number one in the relevant Billboard
                    chart, the acoustic collections of songs, “The Secret Language of Birds”, and “Rupi’s Dance”. In a more progressive rock context he recorded “Thick As A Brick 2” in 2012 and “Homo Erraticus” in 2014. Released in 2017, the classically
                    inspired album “Jethro Tull – The String Quartets” with the Carducci Quartet reached number one in the Billboard Classical Charts. In recent years, he has toured more and more under his own name in solo concerts with orchestras, string
                    quartets, featured soloists and in his other eclectic acoustic shows. Concerts scheduled for 2019/20 will also feature some new work as well as the reprise of some surprise earlier Jethro Tull repertoire, unplayed for many years.

                    Larde. Whilst studying, he won two major competitions, one in Duino 1988 and the other in Kobe in 1989. In 1988, Emmanuel also won the 2nd Prize at the International Scheveningen Music Competition in Scheveningen, Netherlands. Winning
                    these competitions put Pahud in the forefront to become principal flautist in the Basel Radio Symphony, under the direction of Nello Santi which he obtained the position in 1989 whilst finishing his studies in Paris. He resigned from
                    the orchestra in 1992. Pahud also held the principal flautist position at the Munich Philharmonic under Sergiu Celibidache. Pahud graduated at the age of 20 from the Conservatoire in 1990, obtaining the First Prize (Premier Prix).
                    He then continued to advance his studies for the next two years; in style and interpretation with one of France's greatest flautists, Swiss-born Aurèle Nicolet who turned out to be his neighbour. In 1992, Nicolet prepared Pahud in
                    an extensive 10 day rehearsal for both the Geneva International Music Competition, or le Concours International de Genève in September of that year and the audition for principal flautist of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO)
                    in October. He acknowledges achieving both the first prize at le Concours International de Genève and being appointed for the position at the age of 22 by BPO's conductor, Claudio Abbado to his experience with Nicolet.

            <h1>The Trumpet</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-4 lh-sm ">
                The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or
                C Trumpet. The earliest trumpets date back to 1500 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver Tutankhamun's trumpets from his grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and metal trumpets from China date back to this period. Trumpets from
                the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical wonder for its time. There are many distinct types of trumpet, with
                the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or
                sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style
                orchestras), although this practice varies by country. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.

                The timbre of a wind instrument is determined by the way in which the air inside it vibrates. Hence, the timbre depends not only on the shape of the instrument and the length of its tube but also to a subtler degree on the quality of the material of the
                vibrating tube.Brass is the most commonly used material for making "brass" instruments such as the trumpet. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc and has long been used as the material for brass instruments, as it is easy to work with,
                resistant to rusting, and beautiful to look at. The timbre of an instrument depends on the ratio of copper and zinc used, and instrument makers have taken advantage of this to produce instruments with a variety of different sounds. Yellow
                brass, which consists of 70% copper and 30% zinc, produces a bright, forceful timbre, while gold brass, which consists of 85% copper and 15% zinc, produces a rich, expansive timbre.Nickel can be added to copper and zinc to produce nickel-silver-a
                whitish, shiny alloy. Nickel-silver offers better rust-resistance than brass and produces a deep, sonorous sound.Essentially, the lacquer coating or plating applied to the surface of the body of an instrument is intended to protect it
                from rust and dirt. However, coating and plating will also subtly affect the timbre of the instrument.
