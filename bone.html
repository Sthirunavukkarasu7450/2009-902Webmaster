                    <span class="display-4">Christian Lindberg</span> <br>Charles Lindberg is a highly accomplished swedish trombonist, composer, and conductor.In 1981, Lindberg won the Nordic Soloists' Biennale competition. His concert debut was in 1984
                    with the Trombone Concerto by Henri Tomasi. That same year, he signed a 3-CD recording contract with BIS Records. His first solo recording was "The Virtuoso Trombone". Lindberg has recorded over 60 albums, for BIS and several other
                    labels. His musical collaborators in Sweden have included pianist Roland Pöntinen and composer Jan Sandström. Lindberg is noted for his performances of contemporary music, as well as expanding the repertoire of concerti for trombone.
                    In 2006, he estimated that over the prior 25 years, composers wrote 82 works for him. On 7 September 2017, Lindberg gave his 100th trombone concerto premiere. Lindberg was the soloist in the premiere of Sandström's Motorbike Concerto.
                    In addition to the Sandström, his repertoire includes Luciano Berio's Sequenza V, Fredrik Högberg's The Ballad of Kit Bones and Su ba do be. Lindberg began to compose in the 1990s at the encouragement of Sandström. Lindberg's first-performed
                    work was Arabenne for trombone and strings, recorded in 1997. Other compositions have included Mandrake in the Corner, Chick 'a' bone Checkout, from 2006 and written for Charles Vernon of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Kundraan
                    (2008). In 2000, Lindberg made his conducting debut with the Northern Sinfonia in the UK. He has regularly conducted the Nordic Chamber Orchestra (chief conductor, 2004–2011) and the Swedish Wind Ensemble (2005–2012). He was principal
                    conductor of the Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra, and was contracted to the orchestra until 2018. From 2016 to 2021, Lindberg was conductor and music director at the Israel Netanya Kibbutz Orchestra. In 2011 Lindberg and the Norrköping
                    Symphony Orchestra initiated the Allan Pettersson Project, the purpose of which is to record and issue all of Pettersson’s symphonies on CD.

                    <span class="display-4 ">Joseph Alessi</span> <br> As a member of the New York Philharmonic and recorder of his own solo music, Alessi has brought the Trombone into a bigger limelight in America than ever before. During his third year
                    at Curtis, Alessi joined the Philadelphia Orchestra as interim Second Trombone; he later won the job permanently and performed with the orchestra for four seasons. Following one season as Principal Trombone at the Montreal Symphony
                    Orchestra, Alessi joined the New York Philharmonic as Principal Trombone in the Spring of 1985. Alessi made his solo debut with the New York Philharmonic in 1990 when he performed the Fantasy for Trombone by Paul Creston. In 1992,
                    he performed with the New York Philharmonic in the world premiere of the Trombone Concerto by Christopher Rouse, which later received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Music. Alessi has since developed an increasingly new-active solo career,
                    performing throughout the United States and internationally. His discography consists of over 14 full-length albums, in addition to guest appearances on albums by other artists. Recordings of the Rouse Concerto have been released by
                    the New York Philharmonic and the Colorado Symphony, both featuring Alessi as soloist. His 1999 recording of Star-Child, by George Crumb, was voted Best Classical Contemporary Composition at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. Alessi joined
                    the faculty of the Juilliard School in 1986, shortly after joining the New York Philharmonic. The Juilliard trombone studio has since furthered its international reputation as one of the finest trombone college programs, and the Juilliard
                    Trombone Choir has regularly performed with Alessi on his recording projects. Since 1999 Alessi has conducted the Alessi Seminar; a biennial trombone workshop that attracts trombonists from around the world to spend time with him in
                    lessons, masterclasses, and recitals. Several of his past students now occupy senior positions in major orchestras throughout the world. Joseph Alessi and Swedish trombone virtuoso Christian Lindberg are widely regarded as the finest
                    players of the instrument today, arguably the finest in history. In recognition of Alessi's immense contributions to the trombone community, he was awarded the 2002 ITA Award, the most prestigious award offered by the International
                    Trombone Association.

            <h1>The Trombone</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-4 lh-lg ">
                The word "trombone" derives from Italian tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning "large"), so the name means "large trumpet". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like the trumpet, in contrast to the more conical brass instruments like
                the cornet, the euphonium, and the French horn. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. These are treated as non-transposing instruments and are pitched in B♭, an octave below the B♭ trumpet
                and an octave above the pedal B♭ tuba. The once common E♭ alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated
                in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B♭
                transposing instrument, written in treble clef; and the alto trombone is written at concert pitch usually in alto clef.

                The modern system has seven chromatic slide positions on a tenor trombone in B♭. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795. In 1811 Joseph Fröhlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions
                were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A. To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered "drawn past" then current 1st). In the
                modern system, each successive position outward (approximately 3+1⁄4 inches [8 cm]) will produce a note which is one semitone lower when played in the same partial. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to "bend" the
                note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.Unlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a transposing
                instrument. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a "crook")
                or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial
                on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with
                one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully
                retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (e.g. Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor). Trombone parts are typically notated in bass clef, though sometimes also written in
                tenor clef or alto clef. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity
                during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef
                staff (the German Robert Schumann was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass
                clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands. An accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble
                clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B♭ as well.
