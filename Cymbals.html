            <h1>The Crash Cymbal</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-5 lh-sm ">
                Clash cymbals (also called concert cymbals, orchestral cymbals, or crash cymbals) are cymbals played in matched pairs by holding one cymbal in each hand and striking the two together. Zildjian clash cymbals after a big crash Paiste clash cymbals in use
                in a percussion section To differentiate this type of cymbal from a suspended cymbal, they are also called hand cymbals In musical scores, clash cymbals are normally indicated as cymbals or sometimes simply C.C. If another type of cymbal,
                for example a suspended cymbal, is required in an orchestral score, then for historical reasons this is often also indicated cymbals. Some composers and arrangers use the plural cymbals or crash cymbals to indicate clash cymbals, with
                the singular cymbal to indicate a suspended cymbal. Composers will often condense the clash cymbals and a suspended cymbal into the same part. There are a number of techniques used to indicate which is desired. Whenever with stick or with
                mallet is written, a suspended cymbal is used. A return to clash cymbals can be specified with the Italian phrase a due. Russian composers developed a notation to differentiate between clash and suspended cymbals in which a + (plus sign)
                is written over a note to be played on suspended cymbal and a ° (open circle) is written over a note to be played with clash cymbals.
                <h1>The Hi-Hat</h1>
                The hi-hat evolved from a "sock cymbal", a pair of similar cymbals mounted at ground level on a hinged, spring-loaded foot apparatus. Drummers invented the first sock cymbals to enable one drummer to play multiple percussion instruments at the same time.
                Over time these became mounted on short stands—also known as "low-boys"—and activated by pedals similar to those used in modern hi-hats. When extended upward roughly 3' (76 cm) they were originally known as "high sock" cymbals, which evolved
                over time to the familiar "high-hat" term. The cymbals may be played by closing them together with the pedal, which creates a "chck" sound or striking them with a stick, which may be done with them open, closed, open and then closed after
                striking to dampen the ring, or closed and then opened to create a shimmering effect at the end of the note. Depending on how hard a hi-hat is struck and whether it is "open" (i.e., pedal not pressed, so the two cymbals are not closed
                together), a hi-hat can produce a range of dynamics, from very quiet "chck" (or "chick") sounds, done with merely gently pressing the pedal; this is suitable for soft accompaniment during a ballad or the start of a guitar solo, to very
                loud (e.g. striking fully open hats hard with sticks, a technique used in loud heavy metal music songs).

                <h1>The Suspended Cymbal</h1>
                A suspended cymbal is any single cymbal played with a stick or beater rather than struck against another cymbal. Common abbreviations used are "sus. cym.," or "sus. cymb." (with or without the period). Most drum kits contain at least two suspended cymbals:
                a crash cymbal and a ride cymbal.In an orchestral setting, suspended cymbals are most often used for rolled crescendos, or swells. To do this, the percussionist uses a single-stroke roll on the outside edge of the cymbal, using soft mallets,
                one on each side. The terminology most commonly used to describe this technique is a suspended cymbal roll. At times, a score also calls for hitting the cymbal with a stick or scraping it with a triangle beater. Other techniques utilize
                the bow of a contrabass, to be drawn slowly across the outside rim of the cymbal. This technique will give a very shrill, eerie sound, particularly useful in film music. Another lesser-known technique is to place a suspended cymbal upside
                down on a timpani head. The timpanist is instructed to roll ad lib on the suspended cymbal while moving the timpani pedal up and down as a glissando. Film composer Danny Elfman has made great use of this technique, which needs to be performed
                in a more "transparent" orchestral setting to be heard.
                <h1>The Ride Cymbal</h1>
                The ride cymbal is a standard cymbal in most drum kits. It maintains a steady rhythmic pattern, sometimes called a ride pattern, rather than the accent of a crash. It is normally placed on the extreme right (or dominant hand) of a drum set, above the
                floor tom. The ride can fulfill any function or rhythm the hi-hat does, with the exception of an open and closed sound. The ride is played with a drumstick. The term ride means to ride with the music, describing the cymbal's sustain after
                it is struck. The term may depict either the function or characteristic of the instrument. Most cymbal makers manufacture specific cymbals for the purpose. Some drummers use a china cymbal, a sizzle cymbal or a specialized tone such as
                a swish or pang cymbal as a ride cymbal. When playing extremely softly, when using brushes, and when recording, even a thin crash may serve well as a ride cymbal. On the other extreme, when playing extremely loudly, a cymbal designed as
                a ride may serve well as a very loud, long crash.
