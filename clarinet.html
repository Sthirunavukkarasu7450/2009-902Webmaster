            <p class="text-center fs-3 lh-lg ">
                The clarinet is a woodwind instrument said to have been made in the early 1700s/baroque period when trumpets could not achieve some of the musical passages that were required of them. They were able to do what trumpets could not in that time period, acheive
                the clarion register with ease, hence the name, Clarinet. The original clarinet was made with wood and a few keys but over time improvements to the system have brought about the Oehler, Boehm, and Refined Boehm system Clarinets. Each system
                has its own unique advantages with the Boehm system being the most commonly seen clarinet in current times. Beginner Clarinets are often found to be made with plastic which offer decent tone for an affordable price, while wood is often
                the choice of many professionals due to their difference in sound and clarity.

            <h1>The Mouthpiece, Reed, and Ligature</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-6 lh-lg ">
                The moutpiece, ligature, and reed combination affects everything from how in tune you are to even whether or not you sound like a clarinet. Ligatures are the easy part to understand: it holds your reed onto your mouthpiece. Althought many would say it
                doesn't affect how you play, it can oftentimes change the tone of your instrument as well as the pressure with which it holds the reed on. Pressure on the reed is one factor of many which affects tone. The reed itself, is arguably more
                important. Made with cane in most occasions, the single reed vibrates with the moutpiece to create a wave of motion known more commonly as sound. Reeds come in a variety of strengths, which correlate to how stiff the reed itself is. Stronger
                reeds are stiffer to play with, requiring closed mouthpieces for them to vibrate to their full extent whereas softer reeds are less stiff requiring more open mouthpieces for a larger range in vibration. The genra of music you play can
                also impact reed selection. Jazz players tend to prefer softer reeds since they are much much more malleable compared to stronger reeds. Reeds come in filed and unfiled types. Filed cut, also known as french cut reeds, have a thin cut
                right before the vamp of the reed, offering a brighter sound compared to unfiled, American cut reeds. Mouthpieces come in two types: Open and Closed. Closed mouthpieces can be used with soft and strong reeds alike since their steeper facing
                allows for any range of reed vibration. Open mouthpieces however have a less steep facing, meaning open mouthpieces work best on soft reeds doe to it requiring a larger range in reed vibration compared to closed type. They also come in
                a variety of materials from plastic to hard rubber to crystal. Plastic is the most commonly seen with many different plastic moutpieces adored by both professionals and beginners alike. Hard rubber is often the first selection of many
                pro players. Crystal offers brighter sounds in higher registers, but is much more fragile compared to the other two and is not widely used.
