                <span class="display-4">Paul McCandless</span> <br>Paul Brownlee McCandless Jr. was born in Indiana, Pennsylvania, United States, into a musical family. His father (who was also an oboe and English horn player) taught him clarinet, his
                mother piano, and he attended the Manhattan School of Music. In 1971 he auditioned with the New York Philharmonic playing English horn and was a finalist. McCandless has released a series of records of his own compositions with bands he
                led, including All the Mornings Bring (Elektra/Asylum, 1979), Navigator (Landslide, 1981), Heresay (Windham Hill, 1988), Premonition (Windham Hill, 1992). With Oregon, he has recorded over twenty albums, as well as several albums with
                Paul Winter. In 1996, McCandless won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental with Béla Fleck and the Flecktones. He also won Grammys in 2007 and 2011 with the Paul Winter Consort for Best New Age Album and in 1993 for Al Jarreau's album
                Heaven and Earth. His performance on Oregon's album 1000 Kilometers was nominated for a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo in 2009. He won the Down Beat Critics' Poll for Best Established Combo, the Deutscher Schallplatten Preis for
                his album Ectopia, and the Arbeitskreis Jazz im Bundesverband der Phonographishen Wirtschaft Gold Record Award. In 1985, McCandless toured Europe with bassist Barre Phillips and German clarinetist Theo Jörgensmann. He has been a guest
                musician with Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, appearing on the 1999 album Greatest Hits of the 20th Century and the 2002 album Live at the Quick, and has toured with tabla musician Sandip Burman. He was a guest of Leftover Salmon and The
                String Cheese Incident in the late 1990s. He has appeared on stage in duets with pianist Art Lande, with whom he recorded the album Skylight. Since 2013 he has been playing regularly in Europe with the Samo Salamon Bassless Trio. McCandless
                is active in classical music. As an orchestral soloist, he has performed with the Camerata Chamber Orchestra of Mexico City, the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic,
                and the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra. Three of Paul's orchestral scores are heard on the album Oregon in Moscow. "Round Robin", the opening track, received 2001 Grammy nominations for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Instrumental
                Arrangement. In 2014, McCandless began performing with Charged Particles a jazz trio based in San Francisco, including opening the 2015 San Luis Obispo Jazz Festival with them and headlining at the Stanford Jazz Festival. The quartet has
                appeared at Birdland (in New York City), Blues Alley (in Washington, D.C.), Yoshi's Jazz Club, The Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, The Dakota Jazz Club, and other venues throughout the U.S. In 2017, McCandless and Charged Particles
                did a ten-day tour of Indonesia, performing at the Motion Blue Jazz Club (Jakarta), Jazz Centrum (Surabaya), and the Jazz Gunung Bromo Festival (on Mount Bromo)

                <span class="display-4 ">Jennifer Paull</span> <br> Jennifer Paull is an oboe d'amore (alto oboe) soloist. Her career has been spent in researching, instigating, commissioning and publishing repertoire for the oboe d'amore and subsequently,
                the other rare members of the oboe family of instruments. Her aim has been to make this virtually forgotten instrument into a contemporary recital voice, not uniquely one of the Baroque with which it was virtually exclusively associated
                when she began this mission during her studies at the Royal College of Music, London (1964). Edwin Carr was the first international composer to write for her during the late 1960s and others followed as she became known for her specialisation
                and her acclaimed performance as a soloist. Insufficient material had existed before her pioneering work to sustain a recital career on the oboe d’amore. She quickly became established as an oboe d'amore expert, in particular with the
                BBC Symphony Orchestra and BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, with whom she recorded the oboe d'amore obbligati in the BBC Bach Cantata Series. She was later to abandon orchestral playing completely to concentrate entirely on her career as a
                soloist playing the oboe d'amore exclusively. Many works have been written for her for oboe d’amore and the other rare members of the oboe family of instruments, including six each by Leonard Salzedo and Edwin Carr. The Australian composer,
                Ian Keith Harris, has written sixteen. Jennifer Paull gave recitals in Great Britain and Europe with John McCabe, who composed both Concerto for Oboe d'amore and Chamber Orchestra and Dance-Prelude (for oboe d'amore and piano) for her.
                The duo were honoured to give the première of this piece (commissioned by the Merseyside Arts Council and the City of Liverpool) at a Royal Gala Performance in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, at the Liverpool Empire Theatre (1971).
                She has given many concerts and lecture recitals in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East. Working in Novello & Co., London, as Promotion Manager (1970/1972), she was in regular contact with their house composers. Through her continued
                recital work, her contacts with contemporary composers expanded and she subsequently worked both in the management of Bruno Maderna and in close collaboration with Cathy Berberian. Her repertoire through such connections increased sufficiently
                for her to establish her own publishing company, Amoris International, in the mid 1990s. This was based entirely on the fruits of her work. Amoris is Latin for d’amore. In 1995 Jennifer Paull recorded The Oboe d'amore Collection Volume
                I, the first ever CD devoted exclusively to the oboe d'amore: The Oboe d'amore Collection Volume II and The Amoris Consort were recorded in 1996. A further CD, including the Telemann Oboe d'amore Concerto in A Major was recorded by her
                (1997) with the Craiova 'Oltenia' Philharmonic Orchestra under Michel Barras, for the Association François-Xavier Bagnoud.

            <h1>The Oboe</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-5 lh-sm ">
                The oboe (/ˈoʊboʊ/ OH-boh) is a type of double reed woodwind instrument. Oboes are usually made of wood, but may also be made of synthetic materials, such as plastic, resin, or hybrid composites. The most common oboe plays in the treble or soprano range.
                A soprano oboe measures roughly 65 cm (25+1⁄2 in) long, with metal keys, a conical bore and a flared bell. Sound is produced by blowing into the reed at a sufficient air pressure, causing it to vibrate with the air column. The distinctive
                tone is versatile and has been described as "bright". When the word oboe is used alone, it is generally taken to mean the treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family, such as the bass oboe, the cor anglais (English horn),
                or oboe d'amore. Today, the oboe is commonly used as orchestral or solo instrument in symphony orchestras, concert bands and chamber ensembles. The oboe is especially used in classical music, film music, some genres of folk music, and
                is occasionally heard in jazz, rock, pop, and popular music. The oboe is widely recognized as the instrument that tunes the orchestra with its distinctive 'A'. A musician who plays the oboe is called an oboist. In comparison to other modern
                woodwind instruments, the treble oboe is sometimes referred to as having a clear and penetrating voice. The Sprightly Companion, an instruction book published by Henry Playford in 1695, describes the oboe as "Majestical and Stately, and
                not much Inferior to the Trumpet". In the play Angels in America the sound is described as like "that of a duck if the duck were a songbird". The rich timbre is derived from its conical bore (as opposed to the generally cylindrical bore
                of flutes and clarinets). As a result, oboes are easier to hear over other instruments in large ensembles due to its penetrating sound. The highest note is a semitone lower than the nominally highest note of the B♭ clarinet. Since the
                clarinet has a wider range, the lowest note of the B♭ clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe. Music for the standard oboe is written in concert pitch (i.e., it is not a transposing instrument),
                and the instrument has a soprano range, usually from B♭3 to G6. Orchestras tune to a concert A played by the first oboe. According to the League of American Orchestras, this is done because the pitch is secure and its penetrating sound
                makes it ideal for tuning. The pitch of the oboe is affected by the way in which the reed is made. The reed has a significant effect on the sound. Variations in cane and other construction materials, the age of the reed, and differences
                in scrape and length all affect the pitch. German and French reeds, for instance, differ in many ways, causing the sound to vary accordingly. Weather conditions such as temperature and humidity also affect the pitch. Skilled oboists adjust
                their embouchure to compensate for these factors. Subtle manipulation of embouchure and air pressure allows the oboist to express timbre and dynamics.

                The oboe uses a double reed, similar to that used for the bassoon. Most professional oboists make their reeds to suit their individual needs. By making their reeds, oboists can precisely control factors such as tone color, intonation, and responsiveness.
                They can also account for individual embouchure, oral cavity, oboe angle, and air support. Renaissance oboe (shawm), baroque oboe (Stanesby copy, maker Olivier Cottet), classical oboe early 19th century (Copy of Sand Dalton on the original
                by Johann Friedrich Floth), Viennese oboe early 20th century, Viennese oboe late 20th century and a modern oboe Novice oboists rarely make their own reeds, as the process is difficult and time consuming, and frequently purchase reeds from
                a music store instead. Commercially available cane reeds are available in several degrees of hardness; a medium reed is very popular, and most beginners use medium-soft reeds. These reeds, like clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon reeds, are
                made from Arundo donax. As oboists gain more experience, they may start making their own reeds after the model of their teacher or buying handmade reeds (usually from a professional oboist) and using special tools including gougers, pre-gougers,
                guillotines, knives, and other tools to make and adjust reeds to their liking. The reed is considered the part of oboe that makes the instrument so difficult because the individual nature of each reed means that it is hard to achieve a
                consistent sound. Slight variations in temperature, humidity, altitude, weather, and climate can also have an effect on the sound of the reed, as well as minute changes in the physique of the reed. Oboists often prepare several reeds to
                achieve a consistent sound, as well as to prepare for environmental factors such as chipping of a reed or other hazards. Oboists may have different preferred methods for soaking their reeds to produce optimal sounds; the most preferred
                method tends to be to soak the oboe reed in water before playing. Plastic oboe reeds are rarely used, and are less readily available than plastic reeds for other instruments, such as the clarinet. However they do exist, and are produced
                by brands such as Legere.
