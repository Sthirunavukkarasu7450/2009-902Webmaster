            <h1>The Trumpet</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-4 lh-sm ">
                The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or
                C Trumpet. The earliest trumpets date back to 1500 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver Tutankhamun's trumpets from his grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and metal trumpets from China date back to this period. Trumpets from
                the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical wonder for its time. There are many distinct types of trumpet, with
                the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or
                sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style
                orchestras), although this practice varies by country. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.

            <h1>The Mouthpiece, Reed, and Ligature</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-6 lh-lg ">
                The moutpiece, ligature, and reed combination affects everything from how in tune you are to even whether or not you sound like a clarinet. Ligatures are the easy part to understand: it holds your reed onto your mouthpiece. Althought many would say it
                doesn't affect how you play, it can oftentimes change the tone of your instrument as well as the pressure with which it holds the reed on. Pressure on the reed is one factor of many which affects tone. The reed itself, is arguably more
                important. Made with cane in most occasions, the single reed vibrates with the moutpiece to create a wave of motion known more commonly as sound. Reeds come in a variety of strengths, which correlate to how stiff the reed itself is. Stronger
                reeds are stiffer to play with, requiring closed mouthpieces for them to vibrate to their full extent whereas softer reeds are less stiff requiring more open mouthpieces for a larger range in vibration. The genra of music you play can
                also impact reed selection. Jazz players tend to prefer softer reeds since they are much much more malleable compared to stronger reeds. Reeds come in filed and unfiled types. Filed cut, also known as french cut reeds, have a thin cut
                right before the vamp of the reed, offering a brighter sound compared to unfiled, American cut reeds. Mouthpieces come in two types: Open and Closed. Closed mouthpieces can be used with soft and strong reeds alike since their steeper facing
                allows for any range of reed vibration. Open mouthpieces however have a less steep facing, meaning open mouthpieces work best on soft reeds doe to it requiring a larger range in reed vibration compared to closed type. They also come in
                a variety of materials from plastic to hard rubber to crystal. Plastic is the most commonly seen with many different plastic moutpieces adored by both professionals and beginners alike. Hard rubber is often the first selection of many
                pro players. Crystal offers brighter sounds in higher registers, but is much more fragile compared to the other two and is not widely used.
