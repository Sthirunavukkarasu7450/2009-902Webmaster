                    Junior Department. She later joined the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where she studied with Anthony Halstead and Jeff Bryant. Moving to Berlin, she studied with Fergus McWilliam.In 1991, Sarah Willis took the position as second
                    horn with the Berlin State Opera under Daniel Barenboim. She joined the Berlin Philharmonic in 2001, under Simon Rattle, becoming the first female brass player. She has performed with a number of orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony,
                    the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. She also regularly performs with chamber music ensembles. Willis is a presenter on the German TV station Deutsche Welle, where she hosts a program entitled "Sarah’s

                    He left that post in 1990 to devote himself to a solo career and has recorded many of the major works for horn. He is now professor of horn at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria and at the Reina Sofía School of Music in Madrid. Vlatković
                    also participates as a senior artist at the Marlboro Music Festival, and has performed in chamber music and solo recital for the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society. As a student Vlatković claimed prizes at the International Horn Competition
                    in Liége, Belgium, at the 12th Yugoslavian Music Competition and at the "Premo Ancona" Competition in Italy. When Vlatković was awarded the First Prize at the ARD International Competition in Munich in 1983, it had not been awarded
                    to a horn player for 14 years. As a soloist Vlatković has travelled most of the European continent, America, Canada, Mexico, Israel, the Near East, East Africa, Japan and Australia. Among his appearances he has performed with the Radio
                    Symphony Orchestra of Berlin, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields, the Camerata Academica des Mozarteums, and in Japan with the
                    Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra, Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra and the NHK Symphony Orchestra. From 1982 to 1990 Radovan Vlatković was the principal horn at the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra. He left the orchestra to devote
                    himself fully to solo works. In 1992 he accepted a professorship at the "Staatliche Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst" at Stuttgart. Since 1998 he has been a professor at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. For EMI Classics he has
                    recorded, together with the English Chamber Orchestra under Jeffrey Tate, all the Concertos for Horn by W.A. Mozart and Richard Strauss. His recording of the Mozart Concertos for Horn was awarded the German Record Critics' Award. Vlatković
                    played the first performances of works by Elliott Carter, Sofia Gubaidulina and Heinz Holliger, and he premiered the Horn Concerto (2008) written for him by Krzysztof Penderecki. In 2014 Vlatković received an Honorary Membership of
                    the Royal Academy of Music (Hon RAM).

            <h1>The French Horn</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-6 lh-lg ">
                The French horn (since the 1930s known simply as the horn in professional music circles) is a brass instrument made of tubing wrapped into a coil with a flared bell. The double horn in F/B♭ (technically a variety of German horn) is the horn most often
                used by players in professional orchestras and bands, although the descant and triple horn have become increasingly popular. A musician who plays a horn is known as a horn player or hornist. Pitch is controlled through the combination
                of the following factors: speed of air through the instrument (controlled by the player's lungs and thoracic diaphragm); diameter and tension of lip aperture (by the player's lip muscles—the embouchure) in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern
                horn, the operation of valves by the left hand, which route the air into extra sections of tubing. Most horns have lever-operated rotary valves, but some, especially older horns, use piston valves (similar to a trumpet's) and the Vienna
                horn uses double-piston valves, or pumpenvalves. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound in concert situations, in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet.
                A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural harmonics of the instrument (similar to a bugle). Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter.
                The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell. The key of a natural horn can be changed by adding different crooks of different lengths.A crucial element in playing the horn deals with
                the mouthpiece. Most of the time, the mouthpiece is placed in the exact center of the lips, but, because of differences in the formation of the lips and teeth of different players, some tend to play with the mouthpiece slightly off center.
                Although the exact side-to-side placement of the mouthpiece varies for most horn players, the up-and-down placement of the mouthpiece is generally two-thirds on the upper lip and one-third on the lower lip. When playing higher notes, the
                majority of players exert a small degree of additional pressure on the lips using the mouthpiece. However, this is undesirable from the perspective of both endurance and tone: excessive mouthpiece pressure makes the horn sound forced and
                harsh, and decreases player's stamina due to the resulting constricted flow of blood to the lips and lip muscles.

                The horn is most often used as an orchestral and concert band instrument, with its singular tone being employed by composers to achieve specific effects. Leopold Mozart, for example, used horns to signify the hunt, as in his Jagdsinfonie (hunting symphony).
                Telemann wrote much for the horn, and it features prominently in the work of Handel and in Bach's Brandenburg Concerto no. 1. Once the technique of hand-stopping had been developed, allowing fully chromatic playing, composers began to
                write seriously for the horn. Gustav Mahler made great use of the horn's uniquely haunting and distant sound in his symphonies, notably the famous Nachtmusik (serenade) section of his Symphony No. 7. Many composers have written works that
                have become favorites in the horn repertoire. These include Poulenc (Elegie) and Saint-Saëns (Morceau de Concert for horn and orchestra, op. 94 and Romance, op. 36). Others, particularly Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose friend Joseph Leutgeb
                was a noted horn player, wrote extensively for the instrument, including concerti and other solo works. Mozart's A Musical Joke satirizes the limitations of contemporary horn playing, including the risk of selecting the wrong crook by
                mistake. The development of the valve horn was exploited by romantic composers such as Bruckner, Mahler, and Richard Strauss, whose father was a well-known professional horn player. Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks contains one
                of the best known horn solos from this period, relying on the chromatic facility of the valved horn. Schumann's Konzertstück for four horns and orchestra is a notable three-movement work. Brahms had a lifelong love-affair with the instrument,
                with many prominently featured parts throughout his four symphonies. However players today typically play Brahms on modern valved instruments.
