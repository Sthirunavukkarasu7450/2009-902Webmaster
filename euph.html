                and promoted a style of playing described as "traditional vibrato... balanced by... clean and impressive technique, from-the-heart expressiveness, and a sense of calm assurance". He advanced this new image of the instrument through his
                performances of new literature, premiering 4 of the 7 such works commissioned by the former Tubists Universal Brotherhood Association (TUBA) now known as the International Tuba Euphonium Association. He served as its president, and was
                the first euphonium player to do so. Bowman has been involved in the evolution of the instrument. He has served as a consultant for the design of euphonium mouthpieces to the Swiss-based Willson Musical Instrument Company, whose products
                are distributed in North America by Getzen. He has been instrumental in DEG Music Products, which released a line of mouthpieces bearing Bowman's name. Bowman has been on the music faculty at the University of North Texas College of Music
                for twenty-two years (since August 1999), where he is a Regents Professor. He was head of the Brass Department at Duquesne University (1992–1999). Bowman has served on the faculty of seven other universities. He continues to perform as
                a member of several ensembles and serves as a guest instructor and clinician frequently.

            <p class="text-center fs-4 lh-lg ">
                The euphonium is a medium-sized, 3 or 4-valve, often compensating, conical-bore, tenor-voiced brass instrument that derives its name from the Ancient Greek word εὔφωνος euphōnos,[1] meaning "well-sounding" or "sweet-voiced" (εὖ eu means "well" or "good"
                and φωνή phōnē means "sound", hence "of good sound"). The euphonium is a valved instrument. Nearly all current models have piston valves, though some models with rotary valves do exist. The euphonium may be played in bass clef as a non-transposing
                instrument or in treble clef as a transposing instrument. In British brass bands, it is typically treated as a treble-clef instrument, while in American band music, parts may be written in either treble clef or bass clef, or both.

                As a French Horn-voiced brass instrument, the euphonium traces its ancestry to the ophicleide and ultimately back to the serpent. The search for a satisfactory foundational wind instrument that could support massed sound above its pitch took many years.
                While the serpent was used for over two centuries dating back to the late Renaissance, it was notoriously difficult to control its pitch and tone quality due to its disproportionately small open finger holes. The ophicleide, which was
                used in bands and orchestras for a few decades in the early to mid-19th century, used a system of keys and was an improvement over the serpent but was still unreliable, especially in the high register. With the invention of the piston
                valve system c. 1818, the construction of brass instruments with an even sound and facility of playing in all registers became possible. The euphonium is said to have been invented, as a "wide-bore, valved bugle of French Horn range",
                by Ferdinand Sommer of Weimar in 1843, though Carl Moritz in 1838 and Adolphe Sax in 1843 have also been credited.[by whom?] While Sax's family of saxhorns were invented at about the same time and the bass saxhorn is very similar to a
                euphonium, there are also differences—such as the bass saxhorn being narrower throughout the length of the instrument.[6] The "British-style" compensating euphonium was developed in 1874 by David Blaikley, of Boosey & Co,[7] and has been
                in use in Britain since then, with the basic construction little changed. Modern-day euphonium makers have been working to further enhance the construction of the instrument. Companies such as Adams[8] and Besson[9] have been leading the
                way in that respect. Adams euphoniums have developed an adjustable lead-pipe receiver, which allows players to change the timbre of the instrument to whatever they find preferable. Besson has been credited with the introducing an adjustable
                main tuning-slide trigger, which allows players more flexibility with intonation.
