                <span class="display-4">Paul McCandless</span> <br> Although he is a principle Oboist, Pauld Mccandless also playes the bassoon. Paul Brownlee McCandless Jr. was born in Indiana, Pennsylvania, United States, into a musical family. His
                father (who was also an oboe and English horn player) taught him clarinet, his mother piano, and he attended the Manhattan School of Music. In 1971 he auditioned with the New York Philharmonic playing English horn and was a finalist. McCandless
                has released a series of records of his own compositions with bands he led, including All the Mornings Bring (Elektra/Asylum, 1979), Navigator (Landslide, 1981), Heresay (Windham Hill, 1988), Premonition (Windham Hill, 1992). With Oregon,
                he has recorded over twenty albums, as well as several albums with Paul Winter. In 1996, McCandless won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental with Béla Fleck and the Flecktones. He also won Grammys in 2007 and 2011 with the Paul Winter
                Consort for Best New Age Album and in 1993 for Al Jarreau's album Heaven and Earth. His performance on Oregon's album 1000 Kilometers was nominated for a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo in 2009. He won the Down Beat Critics' Poll
                for Best Established Combo, the Deutscher Schallplatten Preis for his album Ectopia, and the Arbeitskreis Jazz im Bundesverband der Phonographishen Wirtschaft Gold Record Award. In 1985, McCandless toured Europe with bassist Barre Phillips
                and German clarinetist Theo Jörgensmann. He has been a guest musician with Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, appearing on the 1999 album Greatest Hits of the 20th Century and the 2002 album Live at the Quick, and has toured with tabla musician
                Sandip Burman. He was a guest of Leftover Salmon and The String Cheese Incident in the late 1990s. He has appeared on stage in duets with pianist Art Lande, with whom he recorded the album Skylight. Since 2013 he has been playing regularly
                in Europe with the Samo Salamon Bassless Trio. McCandless is active in classical music. As an orchestral soloist, he has performed with the Camerata Chamber Orchestra of Mexico City, the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra,
                Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra. Three of Paul's orchestral scores are heard on the album Oregon in Moscow. "Round Robin", the opening track, received 2001 Grammy nominations
                for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Instrumental Arrangement. In 2014, McCandless began performing with Charged Particles a jazz trio based in San Francisco, including opening the 2015 San Luis Obispo Jazz Festival with them and
                headlining at the Stanford Jazz Festival. The quartet has appeared at Birdland (in New York City), Blues Alley (in Washington, D.C.), Yoshi's Jazz Club, The Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, The Dakota Jazz Club, and other venues throughout
                the U.S. In 2017, McCandless and Charged Particles did a ten-day tour of Indonesia, performing at the Motion Blue Jazz Club (Jakarta), Jazz Centrum (Surabaya), and the Jazz Gunung Bromo Festival (on Mount Bromo)

            <h1>The Bassoon</h1>
            <p class="text-center fs-5 lh-sm ">
                The basson, which has only a few keys and from which the modern bassoon developed during the baroque period, is a musical instrument in which a traditional sound endures. Capable of equaling the German-style bassoon until the 19th century, it was the
                most common woodwind low-pitched instrument. While its tuning difficulty and low volume presented difficulties, it is still loved across France due to the richness of its characteristic gentle and expressive timbre. Composers such as Ravel,
                Debussy, Saint Seans and Berlioz produced exquisite works in which the basson features prominently.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-10 text-center gradient-gold-left p-3 p-md-5" data-aos="fade-left">
            <p class="text-center fs-6 lh-lg ">
                The range of the bassoon begins at B♭1 (the first one below the bass staff) and extends upward over three octaves, roughly to the G above the treble staff (G5). However, most writing for bassoon rarely calls for notes above C5 or D5; even Stravinsky's
                opening solo in The Rite of Spring only ascends to D5. Notes higher than this are entirely possible, but seldom written, as they are difficult to produce (often requiring specific reed design features to ensure reliability), and at any
                rate are quite homogeneous in timbre to the same pitches on cor anglais, which can produce them with relative ease. French bassoon has greater facility in the extreme high register, and so repertoire written for it is somewhat likelier
                to include very high notes, although repertoire for French system can be executed on German system without alterations and vice versa. The extensive high register of the bassoon and its frequent role as a lyric tenor have meant that tenor
                clef is very commonly employed in its literature after the Baroque, partly to avoid excessive ledger lines, and, beginning in the 20th century, treble clef is also seen for similar reasons. Bassoon part (0:12) MENU0:00 From Beethoven's

                See media help. Like the other woodwinds, the lowest note is fixed, but A1 is possible with a special extension to the instrument—see "Extended techniques" below. Although the primary tone hole pitches are a pitched perfect 5th lower than
                other non-transposing Western woodwinds (effectively an octave beneath English horn) the bassoon is non-transposing, meaning that notes sounded match the written pitch. Compared to that of the bassoon, the tube, or "bore," of the basson
                is smaller, so producing a strong sound is difficult. To counteract this and make sound production easier, the reed, which is the part that produces the sound, is made larger.
